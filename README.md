# Data-Driven-MPC-for-autonomous-vehicle-simulation-experiments-videos
These are the CarSim&amp;Simulink simulation experiments videos of Data-Driven MPC, PID and MPC.
In this case, the three videos demonstrate the effect of the three algorithms in the simulation from different viewpoints.
The red car is DDMPC, the blue car is PID, and the green car is MPC for vehicle kinematics.The three algorithms are traveling at a fixed speed of 36km/h.
