# Data-Driven Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Vehicle Steering

With the development of autonomous driving technology and the increasing demand for vehicle control, MPC has become a widely researched topic in industry and academia. However, the existing MPC control methods based on vehicle kinematics or dynamics face the challenges of difficult modeling, numerous parameters, strong nonlinearity, and high computational cost.

Keywords: data-driven control, autonomous vehicle steering, model predictive control, path tracking
